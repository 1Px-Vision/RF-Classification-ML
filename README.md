## Overview
This dashboard provides real-time RF signal analysis using an RTL-SDR device. It continuously acquires and processes radio signals, displaying the Power Spectrum, Spectrogram (Waterfall), and Modulation Classification Results.
The system uses a deep learning-based classification model (ONNX format) to identify different modulation types such as BPSK, QPSK, GMSK, FM, OOK, OQPSK, 8PSK, 16QAM, AM-DSB-WC, AM-DSB-SC.

**1. Getting Started**

- Connect the RTL-SDR to your computer.
- Launch the Dashboard by running the Python script.
- Click Start/Stop to begin or halt real-time signal acquisition.
